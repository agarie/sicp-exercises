# SICP Exercises

This repository contains my answers to the exercises from Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd edition, [available
here](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf).

I decided to write the exercises in Racket due to it being a more modern take
on Lisp and as a means to practice it.
